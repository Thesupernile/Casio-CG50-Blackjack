# Casio-CG50-Blackjack
Blackjack, the classic card game but created in python to run on the Casio CG50 calculator.

**DO NOT RUN ON DESKTOP**

The output will be very strangely formatted. The game is designed with the technical limitations of the Casio CG50 in mind so output is specifically tailored for this purpose.
